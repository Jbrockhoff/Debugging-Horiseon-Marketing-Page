# <Debugging Horiseon Marketing Page>

## Description
 This project worked to debug an existing website and clean up HTML and CSS formatting in order to enhance accessibility.

- I wanted to debug this website and reorder HTML and CSS to be more accessible.
- It is extremely important to understand how to debug existing code in this field in order to be successful.
- It helps make things more streamlined and easier to decode, therefore it is more accessible.
- I learned how HTML and CSS work together to create the final form, and how to make sure any changes in HTML is appropriately modified in CSS as needed.
